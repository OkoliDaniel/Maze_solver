# Maze_solver

This project generates a random maze and solves it using depth first search.

It uses the builtin Tkinter library to render graphics. An m by n grid is first constructed, a random maze is then generated from this grid and then automatically solved (if it can be solved). The path from Start to End is displayed in red.

To run the program, clone this repository then run `python3 main.py` in the terminal.
